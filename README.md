# Gruescript Syntax
My version of [Gruescript](https://versificator.itch.io/gruescript) syntax, with better highlighting to reflect that in the editor. Nothing changed except syntax definitions for SublimeText (somewhat useable), VSCode (rubbish), and N++ (useable).
I did this so I could edit `.gru` files in text editors instead of using browsers to code.
